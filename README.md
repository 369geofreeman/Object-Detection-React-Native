As machine learning and the models being trained are progressing forward at a healthy rate, the importance of it being accessible in the browser, or as shown here in a mobile app, has never been more relevant. The increasing speed and accessibility will steer the directions in which we use and interact with our devices greatly. Tensorflowjs is a great example of how easy it can now be for developers to test these models and ideas.
Big players like SnapChat, Spotify and Tinder are already showing the power this has to offer as are smaller startups. Aipoly Vision are amongst a number of startups and companies already putting machine learning to use by using it as an aid to help the visually impaired know more about their surrounding and help with their day to day tasks. Fritz.ai also has a great example app of what the capabilities of well trained models can currently achieve on mobile.
The next decade could see this trend continue and produce some real world changing ideas that will be in the hands of every mobile phone user. Improved medical analysis, e-commerce apps, financial management, driving assistants and more are yet to be seen as our devices become more powerful and the accessibility of machine learning being used in a javascript environment are more common.
